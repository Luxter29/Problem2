# Problem2
2nd problem for asicoderpower

This time I need you to make a quick game: 
The program sets a random number between 0 and 100. The player has to guess which number is.
If the input number is lower, print "the number is higher" and if the input number is higher, "The number is lower".
The player has only 5 attempts, if the player fails, print "GAME OVER; but if the player succed print "You guessed the number in x tries",
where x is the number of attempts.
If it's the correct answer in the first try, also print "Are you a wizard?".
At the end, ask the player to play again.
